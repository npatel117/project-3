		<h3> Introduction </h3>
		<p class="big"> Hello! I am a transfer student majoring in ITM. I invest in Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Etheurem, and Litecoin.</p>
		<p>This year, I have been pretty successful with my investment by gaining more than 220% in returns. Recently, I have started my own real estate business. I buy homes at a rate lower than the market value and flip the property for profits.</p>
		<p class="big">I also read books in my spare time.</p>
		
		<h3> Hobbies </h3>
			<ul class="a">
				<li> Photography </li>
				<li> Reading Non-Fiction books </li>
				<li> Hiking </li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3> My favorite read this month </h3>
		<ul class="c">
			<li> Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell - I love this book for a reason. It says how a well thought decision in one's life is not as rational as some decisions that are made in the blink of an eye.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3> Some great books I read in past few months </h3>
			<ol class="b"> 
				<li> The Secret by Rhonda Byrne - This book is based on pseudo-scientific 'law of attraction' which basically means that our thoughts create the life we live. This book has changed the way I see the world and always be positive under any circumstances. </li>
				<li> The Power by Rhonda Byrne - This book is a sequel to The Secret. </li>
				<li> Unf*ck Yourself by Gary John Bishop - The author stated that in a day, 95% of humans talks are with themselves (self-talk) and he talks about how we should change our talks with our subconscious mind.</li>
				<li> Cryptocurrency Trading & Investing by Aimee Vo - This is the book I started learning about cryptocurrency, blockchain and how to trade them to earn passive income. </li>
			</ol>
