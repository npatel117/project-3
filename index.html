		<h3> My favorite read this month </h3>
		<ul class="c">
			<li> Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell - I love this book for a reason. It says how a well thought decision in one's life is not as rational as some decisions that are made in the blink of an eye.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3> Some great books I read in past few months </h3>
				<ol class="b"> 
					<li> The Secret by Rhonda Byrne - This book is based on pseudo-scientific 'law of attraction' which basically means that our thoughts create the life we live. This book has changed the way I see the world and always be positive under any circumstances. </li>
					<li> The Power by Rhonda Byrne - This book is a sequel to The Secret. </li>
					<li> Unf*ck Yourself by Gary John Bishop - The author stated that in a day, 95% of humans talks are with themselves (self-talk) and he talks about how we should change our talks with our subconscious mind.</li>
					<li> Cryptocurrency Trading and Investing by Aimee Vo - This is the book I started learning about cryptocurrency, blockchain and how to trade them to earn passive income. </li>
				</ol>
